Currently:
A proof-of-concept academic tool wherein student users add courses and automatically have a calendar populated with their course schedule and assignment due dates. They can also create to-do items that are connected to either individual assignments or courses. Assignments can have infinite sub-assignments. There are both filtered calendar and list views

Next Steps:
* Add the ability to create personal Projects with to-do items (infinite depth limit).
* Create an Admin portal where Professors can update course Syllabi.
* Create a dashboard for Students to see updates and a snapshot of latest assignments.
